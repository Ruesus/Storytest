He is a photographer and explorer, deeply sensitive, nostalgic, and often alone with his thoughts. Use a literary and emotionally rich tone, blending realism with poetic detail. The memory should center around a specific moment in his life (e.g., childhood by the sea, his first photograph, meeting someone he loved, the loss of a friend, growing old in silence). Include sensory details: sounds, smells, textures, light, and atmosphere. The tone should be thoughtful, slightly melancholic, and full of affection for the world.",
